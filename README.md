# Agile-Methods-and-the-Scrum-Framework
This hands-on course follows on from COMP 2831 and begins with an in-depth overview of the goals of Agile,
followed by hands-on Scrum implementations. Students learn to implement primary agile methods and the scrum framework.
Topics include: Scrum, Extreme Programming, Lean/Kanban, Dynamic Systems Development Method, and Feature-Driven Development.
In class exercises cover agile practices including self-directed teams, writing of user stories,
agile estimating with relative sizing, co-location, metric reporting and test driven development.
Participants discover how to implement Scrum and how to scale large multiple team projects,
measuring progress at both a micro and macro level to go through release planning. Working in groups all students
are required to participate in an actual project consisting of building a real product from initiation to a team implementation.
Participants will practice Scrum Planning Sessions, Sprint Planning Meetings, daily Scrum Meetings, Sprint Reviews, 
Backlog Grooming Sessions, and Sprint Retrospectives. Each student will experience the roles of Scrum Master, 
Scrum Product Owner,and "The Scrum Team‚Äù both in class face to face and online with a dispersed agile team.
COMP 2833 students will be prepared to move on to the follow on COMP 2836 Agile Business Analysis and Project Leadership.

budget compared to traditional methods
